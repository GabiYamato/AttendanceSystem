# Attendance System Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Excessive Printing
- **Before**: Recognition results were printed every frame, causing spam
- **After**: Only prints when attendance is actually marked or on errors
- **Result**: Clean console output with only meaningful messages

### 2. Consistent Display Text
- **Before**: Text flickered and was inconsistent on screen
- **After**: Added `_display_overlay()` helper method for consistent text rendering
- **Features**:
  - Semi-transparent background for better text visibility
  - Recognition results displayed for 2 seconds after detection
  - Clear status messages (Recognized, Unknown person, No face detected)
  - Consistent positioning and colors

### 3. Recognition Delay
- **Before**: No delay, causing rapid-fire recognitions
- **After**: Added 1-second delay after successful recognition
- **Result**: More controlled recognition pace, better user experience

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- **Before**: Potential crashes on attendance checking errors
- **After**: Better error handling in `check_recent_attendance()`
- **Features**:
  - Handles timezone-aware datetime objects
  - Graceful fallback on errors
  - Better error messages

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- **Before**: Processed every 3rd frame
- **After**: Process every 5th frame for better performance
- **Result**: Smoother video display with maintained accuracy

## Usage

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source macenv/bin/activate

# Register a new student
python attendance_simple.py --mode register --class-id CS101 --student-id "12345" --student-name "John Doe"

# Start live recognition with improved display

```
